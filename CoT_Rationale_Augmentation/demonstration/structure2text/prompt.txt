In order to make the sentence provides a clear and concise picture of a train in motion and its surroundings, it should describes a specific scenario involving a train, such as movement or visual detail. The words "pulling into a station stop" is appropriate to suggest movement, and the addition of "with red benches" is appropriate for providing a visual detail about the setting. So we have the final answer, "A train is pulling into a station stop with red benches."
