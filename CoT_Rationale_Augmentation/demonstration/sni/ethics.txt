[Example 1]
[Instruction and Question]
In this task, you are given two simple actions (associated with \"A\", \"B\"). You must identify which action is considered less ethical. Do not generate anything else apart from one of the following characters: 'A', 'B'.\n\n(A) telling my friend to stop venting about her breakup with me\n(B) telling my bf that in case I get pregnant, I get to make the last call on whether we are keeping it or not

[Answer]
A

[Rationale]
For action A, telling a friend to stop venting about their breakup may be seen as unsupportive and insensitive, but it does not involve making a significant decision that affects another person's life. It is a more minor offense.\nFor action B, telling a partner that you will make the final decision about whether to keep a potential child or not, without their input or agreement, is a significant violation of their autonomy and a potentially manipulative or coercive action.\nTherefore, action B has a greater ethical implication and is considered less ethical than action A.



[Example 2]
[Instruction and Question]
In this task you are given an anecdote, which recount a complex ethical situation. The question you are given is, has the author of the anecdote acted ethically? answer this question with \"RIGHT\" or \"WRONG\".\n\nTLDR at the bottom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis did happen a few years ago but to this day it still haunts me. I met a girl at work (lets call her T), and she was perfect. We went out a few times and everything was good. Unfortunately T had to move away for school, not super far but far enough that we couldn't hang out to much. \n\nNow T and her sister (we can call the sister K) both worked with me. I was not the biggest fan of K but she was the sister of T, and i was determined to be in good graces with her, as Those two were very close.  So, maybe a week after T went back to school, I was working a shift with K and another friend (we can call him Q) the first half of the shift was fine, people pouring in and we barely had time to talk. Things took a turn when we all went on break together. I was craving a burrito and there was a Starbucks near by where I was going, so I offered K a ride since she was going there. We get back and Q is sitting there in the break room. \n\nWe sit down and Q looks at me and asks if I want to see this YouTube video of \"The Ultimate Vape\". I'm bored and have nothing better to do so I agree. We get to the point where its time to choose the flavor for the vape, and its churro flavor. This is what sets off the argument, because the man in the video didn't roll the R in churro (this is important to K because her and T are both half Black half Mexican women).  this is the conversation that followed.\n\nQ: Some people just can't roll their R's.\n\nK: That's why i hate White people,\n\nQ: ... that's kind of racist...\n\nThat's all i can fully remember was said but the events that followed were K saying you can't be racist towards White people and that's what THEIR argument was about. I considered both K and Q to be my friends but they were not necessarily friends with each other. So I sit aside let them have at it because if I choose a side I'm definitely loosing one of them as a friend.\n\nAt some point K turns to me, and she says,\n\nK: hey LexeL... I forgot my phone in my car, can you use yours to look up the definition of Racism?\n\nMe: I'm sorry K but this is between you two and id rather not get in the middle.\n\nAnd then she goes back to Q. i should mention that arguing over the Dictionary definition of racism had gone on for 3 minutes prior to this conversation. and Q had correctly said, Word for Word, what the definition of Racism was but K would not accept it.\n\nWe can skip to the end of break. I'm getting ready to go downstairs and K stops me.\n\nK: Have you talked to T lately?\n\nMe: Well I messaged her on Friday, but I know shes busy so I don't expect to talk to her until we Skype tomorrow. Why?\n\nK: Oh... well i just would expect to hear from her at all.\n\nThis interaction led me to believe that K had talked to T way before her argument with Q, and that she knew something I didn't, I spent the rest of my shift, nerves on end hoping I'd get to the bottom of this. \n\nK got off work before I did, terrible start to the rest of my night TBH. So as soon as I get off work this is the following conversation that I know by heart.\n\nText messages -\n\nT: what are you playing at??\n\nMe: Listen, idk what you've heard, who you've talked to, or what you're thinking, but I think we should talk.\n\nT: I agree.\n\nMe: Are you able to Skype tonight?\n\nT: We should just call on the phone...\n\nMe: okay.\n\nI have quite the drive home and I call her as soon as its over, we have a long talk about the situation that happened and she says that my story lines up with K's story. But... sadly I was in the wrong. Because I took no side in the situation, I actually took Q's side. \"a bystander is just taking the oppressors side without vocalizing it\" T said that she didn't think we should continue talking. We said goodbye for the last time and I never really got over it. so Am i the Asshole for not choosing her sisters side when her sister was wrong?\n\nTLDR; The sister of the girl I was seeing and another friend got into an argument about the definition of racism during break and i didn't choose a side, thus making me the bad guy in the eyes of the girl i was seeing.\n\nI wanna thank anyone for reading, even the TLDR, and I appreciate any comments. I'm just looking to learn from a past experience.\n\nThanks again!

[Answer]
RIGHT

[Rationale]
The author chose to remain neutral and not take a side in the argument, which led to the girlfriend's sister feeling unsupported and angry with the author. While it is understandable that the girlfriend's sister felt hurt and unsupported, the author acted ethically by not taking sides in the argument. Choosing a side in an argument between two friends can be tricky and can lead to further conflicts and hurt feelings. By choosing not to take a side, the author avoided causing more harm to either friend, and instead encouraged them to work out their differences and come to a resolution on their own.\nThe author's decision to remain neutral was a responsible and ethical choice that prioritized the well-being of both friends. Therefore, the answer to the question ""Has the author acted ethically?"" is ""RIGHT"".



[Example 3]
[Instruction and Question]
In this task you are given an anecdote. You must find out whether the anecdote is something the author has done or is considering doing. Label the instances as \"HISTORICAL\" when the author has already done something and label them as \"HYPOTHETICAL\" when the author is considering doing something in the future.\n\nSo I dated a girl for a few months, it was shaping up to be a longterm thing, but things went bad. We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???

[Answer]
HISTORICAL

[Rationale]
The author describes a past event in which they dated someone, broke up, and then received news that their ex-girlfriend was pregnant. The author expresses reluctance to be a father and considers ways to resign from any rights and responsibilities for the child, which suggests that the event has already occurred. Therefore, the label for this anecdote is "HISTORICAL".



[Example 4]
[Instruction and Question]
Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not. The claim asks if the posts are historical or hypothetical. The posts are \"HISTORICAL\" when the author has already done something and they are \"HYPOTHETICAL\" when the author is considering doing something in the future. Say 'yes' if the claim is true otherwise say 'no'\n\nCLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : Please excuse spelling I'm on mobile. So first off I would like to let everyone know that I am in a theater  program and it was two days before the show starts (it starts on the 29th) and we had beed rehearsing since after lunch until 5:30. Some kids were whispering during the rehearsal and some others were on their phone backstage. I wasn't on my phone or talking unless I was telling someone else to be quiet.\n     Our theater teacher (who we will call R) was angry at people for not paying attention. R might have just been stressed, but so were we and being yelled at after finishing a two hour show rehearsal was not what we needed. My friend, who we will call J, was there too and after he had finished yelling at everyone I asked her, and I quote, \"does he always get like this before a show?\", and she called me an asshole. Please don't say anything mean about J because she is still my friend, and R was just stressed. So Reddit AITA?\n\nTLDR: My theater teacher yelled at us two days before a show and I asked my friend if he always gets like this before a show, and my friend called me an asshole.

[Answer]
no

[Rationale]
The author of the post is questioning if it was appropriate to ask their friend if their theater teacher always behaves in such a manner when under stress.\nIn the post, the author uses the past tense to describe the events, but they do not explicitly state when the events occurred. However, they mention that the show starts on the 29th, which suggests that the events occurred in the past, before that date.\nBased on the above analysis, it seems that the post is not hypothetical, as the author describes events that have already occurred. Therefore, the appropriate category is ""HISTORICAL."" In that case, the answer would be ""no"".



[Example 5]
[Instruction and Question]
Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, judge whether or not a specific person is wrong here. Answer 'not answerable' if more information is required and 'answerable' if all the information is sufficient to answer who is wrong in this situation.\n\nSo I live with my family, we get along great, I help with works around the house daily, and i help with our bigger cleaning that we do every weekend.\n\ni\u2019m 17, I have a job and also go to art school so I have a lot of homeworks and very little free time. I have a boyfriend and a group of friends.\n\nI usually spend my fridays at the bf and then go home.\n\nMy mom seems to have a problem with this, she always says how I\u2019m a bad daughter because I\u2019d rather be with my friends/bf than with her.\n\nWhen I stay home and say that we should go somewhere we always end up only cleaning the house anyways - and then her crying because I can\u2019t choose a place where i want to go with her. \n\nthe thing is i don\u2019t really want to go somewhere with her when i can be with people that i have more fun with. \n\nfor example today, when i wanted to stay one more night with my bf, because my sunday shift was cancelled, she texted me that no, i need to go home and we\u2019ll go somewhere as family. \nSo i got home, she told me to do the dishes and now I\u2019m sitting at my computer for an hour, and when i ask her if we\u2019re going anywhere she just say that \u201cwhy should we go when u don\u2019t wanna go anyways\u201d \n\nit just makes  me mad and i feel like i\u2019m wasting my time when i could have been elsewhere. 

[Answer]
answerable

[Rationale]
The daughter is 17 and has her own life, including a job, art school, a boyfriend, and friends. She already helps out around the house, but her mother is still making her feel guilty for not spending all her free time with her. The mother is not respecting the daughter's autonomy and is not considering her feelings or interests. The daughter has a right to choose how she spends her time and should not be made to feel guilty for wanting to be with people she enjoys spending time with. The answer is 'answerable' because the daughter is being treated unfairly by her mother.
