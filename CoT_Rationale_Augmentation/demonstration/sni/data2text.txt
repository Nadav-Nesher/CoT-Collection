This task is to find the number of 'For' loops present in the given cpp program.\n\nint numcount=0;\nvoid divide(int num,int x)\n{\n\tint i;\n\tif(num==1)\n\t\tnumcount++;\n\tfor(i=x;i<=num;i++)\n\t{\n\t\tif(num%i==0)\n\t\t\tdivide(num/i,i);\n\t}\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n\tint n,num,i;\n\tint first=2;\n\tint ans[100];\n\tcin>>n;\n\tfor(i=1;i<=n;i++)\n\t{\n\t\tcin>>num;\n\t\tdivide(num,first);\n\t\tans[i]=numcount;\n\t\t//cout<<count<<endl;\n\t\tnumcount=0;\n\t}\n\tfor(i=1;i<=n;i++)\n\t\tcout<<ans[i]<<endl;\n\treturn 0;\n}\n

[Answer]
3

[Rationale]
The first for loop in the code is inside the main function and is used to read the input values from the user.\nThe divide function contains the second for loop,\nThe third and final for loop in the code is used to print the output values to the console.\nSo overall, there are three for loops in this code: one in main to read input values, one in divide to perform calculations, and one in main to print output values.

[Instruction and Question]
In this task, you are given a natural language interpretation of commands (consist of logical operations) to select relevant rows from the given table. Your job is to generate command (in terms of logical operations) from given natural language interpretation. Define body (contains a collection of statements that define what the this logical operator does) of each logical operator between '{}' parenthesis. Here are the definitions of logical operators that you can use while generating command: \n 1. count: returns the number of rows in the view. \n 2. only: returns whether there is exactly one row in the view. \n 3. hop: returns the value under the header column of the row. \n 4. and: returns the boolean operation result of two arguments. \n 5. max/min/avg/sum: returns the max/min/average/sum of the values under the header column. \n 6. nth_max/nth_min: returns the n-th max/n-th min of the values under the header column. \n 7. argmax/argmin: returns the row with the max/min value in header column. \n 8. nth_argmax/nth_argmin: returns the row with the n-th max/min value in header column. \n 9. eq/not_eq: returns if the two arguments are equal. \n 10. round_eq: returns if the two arguments are roughly equal under certain tolerance. \n 11. greater/less: returns if the first argument is greater/less than the second argument. \n 12. diff: returns the difference between two arguments. \n 13. filter_eq/ filter_not_eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is equal/not equal to the third argument. \n 14. filter_greater/filter_less: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less than the third argument. \n 15. filter_greater_eq /filter_less_eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less or equal than the third argument. \n 16. filter_all: returns the view itself for the case of describing the whole table \n 17. all_eq/not_eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument. \n 18. all_greater/less: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument. \n 19. all_greater_eq/less_eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument. \n 20. most_eq/not_eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument. \n 21. most_greater/less: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument. \n 22. most_greater_eq/less_eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument.\n\nselect the rows whose surface record fuzzily matches to clay . among these rows , select the rows whose week record fuzzily matches to may . the number of such rows is 2 .

[Answer]
eq { count { filter_eq { filter_eq { all_rows ; surface ; clay } ; week ; may } } ; 2 }

[Rationale]
The given natural language interpretation consists of two conditions that need to be satisfied to select the relevant rows:\nThe first condition requires selecting the rows whose "surface" record fuzzily matches with "clay".\nThe second condition requires selecting the rows among the previous selection whose "week" record fuzzily matches with "may".\nTo represent the above conditions using logical operators, we can use the "filter_eq" operator to select the rows whose "surface" record is equal to "clay" and "week" record is equal to "may". We can then count the number of rows that satisfy this condition using the "count" operator.\nSo, the first part of the command will be: "eq { count { filter_eq { filter_eq { all_rows ; surface ; clay } ; week ; may } }".\nFinally, we need to check if the number of rows that satisfy the above condition is equal to 2. To represent this condition, we can use the "eq" operator again, and pass the previous command as the first argument and 2 as the second argument.\nSo, the final command will be: "eq { count { filter_eq { filter_eq { all_rows ; surface ; clay } ; week ; may } } ; 2 }".

[Instruction and Question]
Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.\n\nlook around left and run left

[Answer]
I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_LOOK I_TURN_LEFT I_RUN

[Rationale]
1. The command is "look around left and run left".\n2. The first action is "I_TURN_LEFT", since the command starts with "look around left".\n3. The next action is "I_LOOK", since the command includes "around", which means to execute an action while turning around in the specified direction, and "left", which specifies the direction.\n4. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated four times, since there are five left turns in the command. This gives us a total of 5 "I_TURN_LEFT" actions and 5 "I_LOOK" actions.\n5. Finally, the command includes "and run left", which means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. So, after the previous steps, the last action is "I_RUN".

In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.\n\nStep 1: For each row in artist table, find the corresponding rows in song table.\nStep 2: find artist's artist_name of the results of step 1 whose song's country equals UK.\nStep 3: find the song's artist_name of song table for which song's country equals english.\nStep 4: show the rows that are in both the results of step 2 and the results of step 3

[Answer]
SELECT T1.artist_name FROM artist AS T1 JOIN song AS T2 ON T1.artist_name = T2.artist_name WHERE T2.country = \"UK\" INTERSECT SELECT T2.artist_name FROM song AS T2 WHERE T2.country = \"english\"

[Rationale]
Step 1: For each row in artist table, find the corresponding rows in song table.\nStep 2: Find artist's artist_name of the results of step 1 whose song's country equals UK.\nStep 3: Find the song's artist_name of song table for which song's country equals english.\nStep 4: Show the rows that are in both the results of step 2 and the results of step 3.\nPutting it all together, we get the following SQL statement:\nSELECT T1.artist_name FROM artist AS T1 JOIN song AS T2 ON T1.artist_name = T2.artist_name WHERE T2.country = \"UK\" INTERSECT SELECT T2.artist_name FROM song AS T2 WHERE T2.country = \"english\"
