[Example 1]
[Instruction and Question]
question: Teacher asked me this: Solve 3*j + 16 = -5*j for j.\n++++++++++\nanswer:

[Answer]
-2

[Rationale]
The given equation is 3j + 16 = -5j. To solve for j, we need to isolate j on one side of the equation.

First, we can simplify the equation by adding 5j to both sides:

3j + 16 + 5j = 0

Combining like terms, we get:

8j + 16 = 0

Subtracting 16 from both sides:

8j = -16

Dividing both sides by 8:

j = -2

Therefore, the solution for j is -2.

Solve 1875954*s - 817 = 1875935*s for s.\nSolve this plz.\nA:

[Answer]
43

[Rationale]
We need to isolate the variable s on one side of the equation.

[STEP 1] 1875954*s - 1875935*s = 817
[STEP 2] 19*s = 817
[STEP3] s = 817/19
[STEP4] s = 43

QUESTION: Math problem: Solve 2767686 = 158*f + 2754414 for f.\nANS:

[Answer]
84

[Rationale]
[STEP 1] 2767686 - 2754414 = 158*f
[STEP 2] 13272 = 158*f
[STEP 3] 13272/158 = f
[STEP 4] f = 84



[Example 4]
[Instruction and Question]
Q: What is the solution?\nSolve -46*y + 24 = -34*y for y.\n\nA:

[Answer]
2

[Rationale]
We need to isolate the variable y on one side of the equation.

[STEP 1] 46*y - 34*y = 24
[STEP 2] 12*y = 24
[STEP3] y = 24 / 12
[STEP4] y = 2



[Example 5]
[Instruction and Question]
Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -21181 + 8447 = 497*p + 9401 + 3709 for p.\nanswer:

[Answer]
-52

[Rationale]
-21181 + 8447 = 497p + 9401 + 3709

Simplifying the left-hand side of the equation:

-12734 = 497p + 13110

Subtracting 13110 from both sides:

-25844 = 497p

Dividing both sides by 497:

p = -52

Therefore, the solution for the given math problem is p = -52.



[Example 6]
[Instruction and Question]
Q: Solve 493 = 18*r + 403 for r.\n\nA:

[Answer]
5

[Rationale]
To solve for r, we need to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.

Starting with:

493 = 18*r + 403

Subtract 403 from both sides:

90 = 18*r

Divide both sides by 18:

r = 5

Therefore, the solution for r is 5.
