[Example 1]
[Instruction and Question] 
There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?

[Answer]
6

[Rationale]
We start with 15 trees. Later we have 21 trees. The difference must be the number of trees they planted. So, they must have planted 21 - 15 = 6 trees.



[Example 2]
[Instruction and Question] 
If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?

[Example 3]
[Instruction and Question] 
Leah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42. If they ate 35, how many pieces do they have left in total?

[Answer] 
39

[Rationale]
Leah had 32 chocolates and Leah's sister had 42. That means there were originally 32 + 42 = 74 chocolates. 35 have been eaten. So in total they still have 74 - 35 = 39 chocolates. 



[Example 4]
[Instruction and Question] 
Jason had 20 lollipops. He gave Denny some lollipops. Now Jason has 12 lollipops. How many lollipops did Jason give to Denny?

[Answer] 
8

[Rationale]
Jason had 20 lollipops. Since he only has 12 now, he must have given the rest to Denny. The number of lollipops he has given to Denny must have been 20 - 12 = 8 lollipops.
